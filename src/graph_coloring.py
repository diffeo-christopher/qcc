  # To check whether pairs of qubits are the same we
  # follow this recipe:
  #   To check whether two qubits are the same, a simple
  #   Controlled-Not will do:
  #     q0 ---o---
  #     q1    |
  #     q2 ---X---
  #
  #   If the qubits were the same, q2 will be |0>.
  #
  #   However, this also changes q2, so we have to store away
  #   the result and undo the Controlled-Not:
  #     q0 ---o-------o---
  #     q1    |       |
  #     q2 ---X-X-o-X-X---
  #     q3        |
  #      w -------X------- 1 if q0 == q2
  #
  # To do this for two qubits, we have to compute two worker qubits
  # and finally AND them together. To make the AND work, both inputs
  # should be 1, hence we have to add an X-gate to the workers before
  # applying a CXX gate (or use cx0 for convenience).
  #
  # As a result, if the pairs are equal, the final result of
  # the AND will be |1> in the chk qubit.
