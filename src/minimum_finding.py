# This is the implementation of a quantum minimum finding algorithm
# after Durr and Hoyer, "A Quantum Algorithm for Finding the Minimum"
# (https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9607014).
#
# To establish a quantum advantage, the algorithm makes several
# pretty rough assumptions and simplifications. Here is the algorithm
# (and implementation) to the best of my understanding:
#
# 1) First we create a set of random numbers in function 'get_distro'.
#    The goal is to find the smallest of these numbers. Since we use
#    Grover, the number of solutions should be small'ish compared to
#    the available space to be able to find a solution with good
#    probability.
#
# 2) Simular to 'regular' Grover, as shown in grover.py, we now construct
#    a function in 'make_f' that returns a 1 for every number in the set.
#    However, there is a little twist: We only mark a value if it is
#    smaller than a given maximum.
#
# 3) The third step is now identical to what is found in grover.py
#    We simply use Grover to find one of the marked items. Using our
#    oracle approach, this works like a charm.
#
# 4) As for measurement, we simulate measurement by simply picking one
#    of the found elements - they all have the higher probability than
#    the other states. We now use this found element as a new upper bound
#    for marking elements.
#
# 5) Now, go back to step 2 and use the newly found upper bound as the
#    new maximum for marking numbers. This is sort of like binary search
#    towards the smallest element, except by using a random lower point
#    to restart the search.
#
# 6) As soon as we hit the smallest number in the set, we stop - we
#    have found the smallest element.
#
# Of course, there are concerns.
#    - the oracle has to be constructed. However, the assumption in the
#      paper is that this is free and comes at no cost.
#    - we terminate when we find the smallest number. This requires
#      knowledge of the smallest number.
#    - we must know how many numbers remain below a current maximum
#      in order to adjust the Grover iteration number.
#
# The last two points could be solved via quantum counting or perhaps
# other mechanisms to find when there is no more solution to be marked.
#
# All together, the description of the algorithm look quite cryptic and
# I have yet to find a working version on the interwebs. This implementation
# - assuming I understood the algorithm correctly - works.
