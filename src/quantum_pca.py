"""Example: Quantum Principal Component Analysis (PCA)."""


# This PCA data set and implementation is from this paper:
#   Quantum Algorithm Implementation for Beginners
#   https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.03719.pdf
#
# A sample implementation can be found here:
#   https://github.com/Haokai-Zhang/ExampleQPCA
#
# The implementation here closely follows the sample implementation
# in order to avoid confusion. Thanks to Haokai-Zhang for his
# contributions (couldn't have done it without it!).
